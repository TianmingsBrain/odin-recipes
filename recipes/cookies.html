        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup white, oat, or spelt flour</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/3 cup chocolate chips</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp milk of choice, plus more if needed</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp oil or melted vegan butter</li>
                <li> 1/4 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees (F). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper; set aside.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl whisk together the coconut oil, 
                    brown sugar, and vanilla, beating until well combined. 
                    Add in the coconut milk and applesauce and whisk until 
                    well combined; set aside. In a separate bowl combine 
                    the flour, baking soda, and salt; whisk well to combine.</li>
                <li>Add the dry ingredients into the wet mixture and, 
                    using a wooden spoon or very sturdy spatula, 
                    stir until ingredients are combined. The batter will be
                     very thick! Fold in 1 and 3/4 cups of the chocolate chips.</li>
                <li>Scoop three tablespoon sized mounds of dough onto the prepared
                     cookie sheet, leaving a few inches between each cookies for 
                     spreading. Bake for 9 to 10 minutes, or until the edges are 
                     golden and the centers have set. Press remaining chocolate 
                     chips on top of warm cookies, and sprinkle with sea salt, if 
                     using. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 15 minutes before
                      transferring them to a cooling rack.</li>
            </ol>
